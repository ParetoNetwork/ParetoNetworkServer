Frontand and Backend for calculating ranking and all other functions of the Pareto Network intel feed.

This implements two parts of the ranking algorithm so far, and can do a client side calculation first primarily for cosmetic purposes.

There are only several views:

The splash view - intended to be straight to the point with a clear call to action.

The about view - goes into more detail about what the Pareto Network is and who is behind it

The dashboard - the product, where users can view the stream of intel that they are privy to see

The rank - shows the user their current score and ranking within the Pareto system.

## DEVELOPMENT SETUP

To start backend Service follow the next steps:

- Install the latest Docker version.
- The file _docker-compose.yml_  will have all the configuration to deploy _Redis_ and _Mongo_ into your development environment, it will also execute a migration to import a backup  into your _Mongo_ instance with the collections required for this project to run.
- Before running the _Node.js_ application run: *docker-compose up*
- Finally, the following configuration ass environment variables:
    -  For _Mongo_ the docker container will expose port *27018* so update *MONGODB_URI* properly to point to your local instance like this: *mongodb://localhost:27018/pareto*
    -  For _Redis_ the docker container will export port  *27017* so you will need to add the following enviroment variable: *REDIS_URL* with the full connection URL to *Redis* like this: *redis://localhost:27019*
    -  For Frontend Application communication, the environment variable *FRONTEND_SERVER* must be inicializated in *http://localhost:8080*
- if the configuration is successful you should see something like this on your console after you run the *Node.js* app:

```
PARETO: Success connecting to Redis
PARETO: Success connecting to Mongo 
Pareto Network ranking app listening on port 3000!
```
To start frontEnd application follow the next steps:
- start backend Service
- install dependencies if are not installed (inside /frontend folder execute in terminal: *npm i*)
- run application executing in terminal  *npm run-script --prefix frontend serve*  on root project folder; or execute *npm run-script serve* inside /frontend folder

## UNIT TEST SETUP

To start unitTest follow the next steps:
- make sure that all dependecies are installed (docker, package.json in root project folder, package.json in /frondtend folder)
- install vue unit test dependencies with
    - vue add @vue/unit-mocha   (inside /frontend folder)
- Before running the test application run: *docker-compose up*
- create a file in /test/ and named mocha.env.js
- inside the /test/mocha.env.js create the environment variables according DEVELOPMENT SETUP. The variable *SIGN* must be contain in json string the return data from MetaMask of the user to be tested:
    - process.env.REDIS_URL
    - process.env.MONGODB_URI
    - process.env.FRONTEND_SERVER
    - process.env.SIGN
    - process.env.CRED_MONGODB
    - process.env.CRED_PARETOCONTRACT
    - process.env.SPECTED_SCORE
    - process.env.SPECTED_PRECISION
- Execute unit_test backend  *npm run-script test --  --opts ./mocha.opts*
- Execute unit_test frontend  *npm run-script --prefix frontend test:unit*
